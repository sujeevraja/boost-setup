# boost-setup

Sample C++ project with boost logging and command-line arguments.
Logging includes colored logging to the console and formatted logging to
"logs/console.log".
 
# Dependencies

- Built Boost binaries.
- CMake.

# Usage

- Clone the repo and change BOOST_ROOT in "CMakeLists.txt" if needed. This path
  should be a folder generated by [building Boost](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html).
  Specifically, it should have "include" and "lib" folders.
- Go to the "build" folder in a terminal and run "cmake ..".
- Go to the "bin" folder and run "./main". To see available CLI arguments, run
  "./main -h".
